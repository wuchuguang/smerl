NOTE: SINCE ErlyWeb 0.4, Smerl IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED IN THIS LOCATION. THE CURRENT VERSION OF Smerl IS NOW IN THE ErlyWeb REPOSITORY AT http://code.google.com/p/erlyweb.

Smerl is a library that simplifies the generation and manipulation of Erlang code in runtime.

Complete documentation is only in the code for now. You can also visit the Smerl blog, currently at http://yarivsblog/articles/tag/smerl, for announcements, tutorials and examples.
